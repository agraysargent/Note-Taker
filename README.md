# Note-Taker

This assignment required us to create a Note Taker application utilizing javascript, express.js and finalizing the application via Heroku.

# User Story

AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

# Description

Note Takers are beneficial as they can assist students and others to take notes for various items. This note taker in particular is online, so if a person is lacking pen & paper, they have other options.

# Considerations

As I worked on this assignment, I ran into Heroku application upload errors, in addition to successfully connecting the back and front ends.

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
